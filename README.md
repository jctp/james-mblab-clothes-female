![James's Clothing Asset Pack (Feminine) - For the MB-Lab Addon for Blender - AGPL Licence (With Exceptions for 2D Rendering)](https://github.com/jctp/james-mblab-clothes-female/blob/main/Images/Title%20Card.png?raw=true)

# Welcome!
This is the GitHub and main download page for James's Clothing Asset Pack (Feminine) (a.k.a. JCAP-F), an open pack of clothing assets for the wonderful [MB-Lab](https://github.com/animate1978/MB-Lab) (formerly ManuelBastoniLAB) addon for Blender. This project is independent of the main MB-Lab project and aims to fill a gap between MB-Lab and the likes of Daz 3D, MakeHuman, and Poser, in that few to no ready-made clothing assets are available for the system.

The aim of this project is to provide a range of generic clothes which can be used as-is with the proxy-fitting feature of the MB-Lab addon, or as a base for creating your own. The styles available focus on modern real-life clothing and not historical, fantasy, sci-fi, or erotic styles.

As of April 2021 the focus of the project is on feminine-style clothing; this will expand in the near future to include masculine styles as well.

# Licence
As many of the clothing items derive mesh data from that contained in MB-Lab itself, JCAP-F inherits the **GNU Affero GPL v3** licence from that project, **with an exception for 2D non-reversible renderings generated using the software, which will fall under the sole copyright of the author to use as they wish.** 

This is important to note if you intend to use these assets in, for example, a game where they are rendered in real-time; the AGPL licence will require distribution under the same copyright.

For the full and official legal text of the MB-Lab project, which this project inherits, see [here](https://github.com/animate1978/MB-Lab/blob/master/license.txt).

## Credits
Some materials come by way of the utterly brilliant https://cc0textures.com/, which provides extremely high-quality PBR materials without usage restrictions and is an absolutely indispensible part of any CGI artist's toolbox.

Patterns come from CC0/public domain sources found around the internet. Whilst I believe in good faith that they are indeed public domain, they are user-submitted content and as with any such content sadly run the risk of having been fraudently uploaded under an open licence without any authority to do so. If this has happened to any of the patterns used in this project and you are or represent the copyright owner, please let me know **immediately** so we can correct the issue.

# Package Contents
To see the contents of this package, see Contents.txt.

# Download
**DOWNLOAD LINK TO BE ADDED SHORTLY**

Download the .zip file and unpack in a suitable location. To add an item of clothing to your scene, use the append option under File in Blender and select from the Objects category. Textures are provided in PNG and GIMP XCF files for modification if required.

# Current Issues
These assets are (as of April 2021) in an extremely early stage of development. Current issues are as follows:

- Some clothing items (particularly those which are not derived from MB-Labs meshes) suffer from poor topology. I am a rank amateur in this area and this project is, in part, a learning exercise. While functional, they will need cleaning up.
- The pack currently cannot be used with the internal MB-Labs library function; assets must be appended using Blender.
- Assets cannot currently be applied to male meshes.

Happy Blending! :)
